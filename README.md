# Habit Tracker
An app to track habits over the current month. Tracked over a calendar-style grid. Habits completed each day show a green grid box. Habits not completed on a day show red. Progress currently stored in localStorage. 

Current work in progress

Needs:
- Rearrange UI (current UI configured to get app logic working)
- Make sure UI is responsive
- Host
- Implement account logins to better track/handle user data
